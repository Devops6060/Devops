Diplay the location of a program/command, where it is installed.

A: If it is in your path, then you can run either type git or "which git". The which command has had problems getting the proper path (confusion between environment and dot files). For type, you can get just the path with the -p argument.

If it is not in your path, then it's best to look for it with "locate -b" git It will find anything named 'git'. It'll be a long list, so might be good to qualify it with "locate -b git | fgrep -w bin".

Understand the output of command used in above question of displaying processes, explain the meaning of each column and what data it displays?

A:  top displays the current time.followed by the system uptime, which tells us the time for which the system has been running.the number of active user sessions

 PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND

A: Edit the ~/.bashrc file and add the following line:

$ PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a'
Now whenever you execute any command,it will be immediately added to the history file

NOTE:- TAB key is your friend when it comes to command completion and having long file and directory names autocompleted at the bash prompt for you. JUST BE LAZY AND USE TAB KEY FOR AUTO COMPLETION ;-)


What are the different types of shell and where are they used and how do we use them?

A:
Bourne Shell : It is faster and more preferred. It lacks features for interactive use like the ability to recall previous commands
C Shell      :It includes helpful programming features like built-in arithmetic and C-like expression syntax
Korn Shell   : It includes features like built-in arithmetic and C-like arrays, functions, and string-manipulation facilities.It is faster than C shell. itis compatible with script written for C shell.
Bourne-Again Shell: It is compatible to the Bourne shell. It includes features from Korn and Bourne shell


What is the difference between login shell and non-login shell?

A: login shell: A login shell is the first process that executes under your user ID when you log in for an interactive session
   non-login shell: When you log in on a text console, or through SSH, or with su -, you get an interactive login shell

   

How do we start login shell and non-login shell?

loginshell=yes : Place in .profile file

Non loginshell : These shells don't read .login or .profile. In addition, bash allows a nonlogin shell to read ~/.bashrc or not



What happens when you start a login shell (which files are read and used and Why)?

it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists. After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable



What happens when you start a non-login shell (Which files are read and used and Why)?


What are Shell Configuration Files, why do we need it?

A: The /etc/profile file – it stores system-wide environment configurations and startup programs for login setup. All configurations that you want to apply to all system users’ environments should be added in this file.

Explain the Order of file usage from the system/user's home directory when user logs in to the System.


What are Shell Variables, list major shell variables and what do they represent?

A variable is a character string to which we assign a value. The value assigned could be a number, text, filename, device, or any other type of data.

A variable is nothing more than a pointer to the actual data. The shell enables you to create, assign, and delete variables

1.Defining Variables
2.Accessing Values
3.Read-only Variables
4.Unsetting Variables


How we see all our env variables?

A: env



How we see all env variables in alphabical order?

A: env | sort


What Format does the env var and its values are stored?

A: Variables have following format

KEY=value
KEY="Some other value"
KEY=value1:value2


How do you create your own varible?

A: To create a variable merely choose a lower-case name for the variable and give it a value using an equal (=) sign. Make certain that there are no spaces on either side of the equal sign.


How do you start a new bash shell?

A; bash -c 'gnome-terminal -x cd /absolute-path && program_name'


Difference between Local/Shell variables to Global Variable

A: 1.Local variable is declared inside a function whereas Global variable is declared outside the function.
   
   2.Local variables are created when the function has started execution and is lost when the function terminates, on the other hand, Global variable is created as execution starts and is lost when the program ends



Show the real life use case of exporting a variable

export JAVA_HOME=jdk-install-dir



What is Globbing? Explain in depth with examples?

A: The Bash shell feature that is used for matching or expanding specific types of patterns is called globbing. Globbing is mainly used to match filenames or searching for content in a file

  ls -l ????.txt
  
  Display files end with extension "txt"
  
  ls -l foot????.doc



List all entries with extension ".sh"

A: ls -l  *.sh


List all entries with numbers in it.

A: ls -l [1-5] : you can give the set of range

List all entries that starts with a character and ends with a number

A: s -l {?????.sh,*st.txt}, ls a*+(5|7)


List all entries that name length more than 5 characters

s -l {?????.sh}


What is Quoting? and Why do we need it?

A: Quoting is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or words to the shell. Quoting can be used to disable special treatment for special characters, to prevent reserved words from being recognized as such, and to prevent parameter expansion.

59.Write few(minimum 3) unique examples that shows, how a particular problem is solved using Quoting.

A: #!/bin/sh

echo Hello; Word
Upon execution, you will receive the following result −

Hello
./test.sh: line 2: Word: command not found

shell returned 127
Let us now try using a quoted character −


#!/bin/sh

echo Hello\; Word
Upon execution, you will receive the following result 

Hello; Word

 

How do you find a particular files/directories based on a particular search criteria?
HINT:- look for commands -> locate, find and whereis

A: find . -name devops.txt: Search files on name
   find / -type d -name devops: Search on directory
   locate "*.html" -n 20:  show the first 20 files that end with 'html'
   locate -i *text.txt*: Ignore case sensitive
   whereis ls: search for ls command


   
Write major difference between locate, find and whereis?

A: 
whereis: will search only particular paths to find binaries and or manpages. The manpages tells you where whereis looks.

locate: locate uses a database created by an updatedb to efficiently locate files. Works great, assuming your database is updated often enough to be reasonable upto date. Most boxes using locate have the updatedb occuring in cron.

find: find is perhaps one of the most powerful commands there is. For just locating a file/program of a particular name, it'll definitely be slower than locate or whereis becuase it will search each and every path recursively from it's start point



How Globbing is different from locate, find and whereis?

A: Globbing is find files based on charecters and numbers only.when it comes to locate, find and whereis find files by time, location, permissions, date, etc.



Explain the Linux File System.

A: A file system is a logical collection of files on a partition or disk. A partition is a container for information and can span an entire hard drive if desired.

Your hard drive can have various partitions which usually contain only one file system, such as one file system housing the /file system or another containing the /home file system.



Explain absolute and Relative Paths

A: An absolute or full path points to the same location in a file system, regardless of the current working directory. To do that, it must include the root directory. By contrast, a relative path starts from some given working directory, avoiding the need to provide the full absolute path
